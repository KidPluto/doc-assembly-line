# The Document Assembly Line Project

This project is an assembly line to rapidly create mobile-friendly online court forms and _pro se_ materials for key areas of urgent legal need amid the COVID-19 crisis. We're operating out of [Suffolk Law's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/) in cooperation with the Massachusetts [Access to Justice Commission](http://www.massa2j.org/a2j/)'s COVID-19 task force. Though we're focused on MA specific content, we're sharing our work [here on GitHub](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line) in the hopes that our efforts can be replicated in other jurisdictions. All novel code we generate will be licensed under an [MIT License](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line/blob/master/LICENSE), and we're intentionally building on the open source [docassemble](https://docassemble.org/) platform. Here's [what we're doing](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line#what-we-are-doing), and [how you can help](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line#how-you-can-help).

_Note: the situation is quickly evolving, and everything here could change at any moment._
